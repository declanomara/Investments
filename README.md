## About
This project is a collection of tools for trading forex. It is written in Rust to ensure stability and speed, two obviously critical factors in trading. It is designed to be modular, so that it can be easily extended to support other markets and trading strategies. It is currently in the early stages of development, and is not designed for public use, but rather to allow me to learn more about trading and Rust, and hopefully make some money in the process.

## Structure
This project contains the following crates:
- `quantlib`: The main crate, containing the shared code for the project.
- `trading`: The trading bot, which is used to trade forex.
- `(planned) research`: The research crate, which will be to research trading strategies.
- `(planned) data`: The data crate, which will be used to download and store data.
